# Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values - Day 3 Challenge

In this challenge, we perform data cleaning by handling missing values and outliers in a dataset. This process is essential for preparing data for machine learning model training. The implementation is provided in the attached Jupyter notebook (`DataCleaning.ipynb`), which goes through each step in detail.

## Objective

Gain hands-on experience in data cleaning by handling missing values and outliers. This is an essential skill in machine learning engineering, ensuring data quality before model training.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Load the Dataset with Missing Values

- **Dataset**: The Titanic dataset, known for containing missing values in certain columns.
- **Data Loading**: Load the dataset directly from `seaborn` or download it from Kaggle.

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  import seaborn as sns

  # Load the Titanic dataset
  df = sns.load_dataset("titanic")
  ```

### 2. Identify Missing Values

- **Missing Values Detection**: Identify which columns contain missing values.
- **Percentage Calculation**: Calculate the percentage of missing values for each column to understand the extent of data gaps.

### 3. Handle Missing Values

- **Numerical Columns** (e.g., `age` and `fare`):
  - Impute missing values with the mean or median of the column.
- **Categorical Columns** (e.g., `embark_town` and `deck`):
  - Impute missing values with the most frequent value (mode) in the column.
- **Summary of Imputation**: Explain the rationale behind choosing mean, median, or mode for each column.

### 4. Outlier Detection and Treatment

- **Outlier Detection**: Use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect outliers in numerical columns (`age` and `fare`).
  - Define outliers as values outside of \([Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR, Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR]\).
- **Outlier Treatment**: Choose one of the following approaches:
  - **Capping**: Cap outliers to the nearest non-outlier value.
  - **Removing**: Remove outlier rows entirely.
- **Summary of Outlier Treatment**: Document the detected outliers and the approach used to handle them.

### 5. Standardization (Bonus Task)

- **Standardization**: Standardize numerical columns (`age` and `fare`) to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step ensures features are on a similar scale, which can be beneficial for various machine learning models.

### 6. Output Summary

- **Cleaned Dataset**: Display the cleaned dataset with all transformations applied.
- **Summary Report**: Summarize the imputation and outlier handling decisions for easy reference.
