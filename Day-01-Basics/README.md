# Python and NumPy Review - Day 1 Challenge

This repository is organized to reinforce Python and NumPy fundamentals, setting a strong foundation for data manipulation tasks in machine learning. The tasks are divided into four main folders:

1. `beginner-python/`
2. `numpy-basics/`
3. `matrix-operations/`
4. `array-manipulation/`

Each folder contains specific tasks to build your skills in Python programming, NumPy operations, and matrix manipulations.

## Folder Structure and Tasks

### 1. `beginner-python/`
This folder covers basic Python programming concepts. The tasks here include:
- **Finding the Maximum, Minimum, and Average**: Write a function to calculate the maximum, minimum, and average of a list of numbers.
- **String Manipulation**: Write a function to reverse a string and count the number of vowels in it.
- **Dictionary Sorting**: Write functions to sort a dictionary by values and by keys.

### 2. `numpy-basics/`
This folder focuses on NumPy basics and array manipulations. Tasks include:
- **Creating a 3x3 NumPy Array**: Create an array of shape `3x3` filled with random integers between 1 and 100.
- **Array Statistics**: Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and sum of the array elements.
- **Reshaping and Transposing**: Reshape the array into shapes `1x9` and `9x1`, then transpose it.

### 3. `matrix-operations/`
This folder involves performing matrix operations using NumPy. The tasks here are:
- **Generate Two Random 3x3 Matrices**: Generate two `3x3` matrices with random values.
- **Element-wise Operations**: Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Perform matrix multiplication of the two matrices.
- **Determinant Calculation**: Calculate the determinant of each matrix.

### 4. `array-manipulation/`
This folder demonstrates array indexing and slicing techniques. Tasks include:
- **Creating an Array of Integers**: Create an array of integers from 1 to 20.
- **Array Slicing**: Extract even numbers, reverse the array, and extract every third element.

### Bonus Task (optional)
- **Unique Values**: Write a function that takes a 2D NumPy array and returns a list of unique values in sorted order.

## How to Use
Each folder contains a `.py` file with solutions for the respective tasks. Run these files individually to see the output for each task.

Happy coding!
